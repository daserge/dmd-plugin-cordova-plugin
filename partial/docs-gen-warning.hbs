## This documentation is generated by a tool

[jsdoc-to-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdoc-to-markdown) is used to generate the docs.
Documentation consists of template and API docs produced from the plugin JS code and should be regenerated before each commit (done automatically via [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky), running `npm run gen-docs-abs` script as a precommit hook - see [package.json](package.json) for details).
