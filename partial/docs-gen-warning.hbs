## This documentation is generated by a tool

:warning: Run `npm install` in the plugin repo to enable automatic docs generation if you plan to send a PR.  
[jsdoc-to-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdoc-to-markdown) is used to generate the docs.  
Documentation consists of template and API docs produced from the plugin JS code and should be regenerated before each commit (done automatically via [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky), running `npm run gen-docs-abs` script as a `precommit` hook - see `package.json` for details).
